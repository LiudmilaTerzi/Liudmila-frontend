          <p>As you already know: the world is a beautiful place. There are so many exceptional places to visit before you die!</p>
          <p>Remember, that often the best surprises lurk in the simple pleasures, so do not always look for the most “popular”, but rather get off the beaten tourist track and really explore!</p>

           <i>“Stuff your eyes with wonder, live as if you’d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories.”</i>
